# Help and Contributing

Thank you for your interest in supporting the DrawPix project!

At this time, **we do not accept code contributions, pull requests, or complex external feature proposals.** The project's core development is handled internally to maintain its limited, focused scope.

However, your input is still crucial and valued in two key areas: **Bug Reporting** and **Feature Suggestions**.

## 🐞 Report a Bug (Help Us Fix Issues!)

If you encounter an error, security issue, or anything that isn't working as expected with the website or the server, please follow these steps to help us fix it quickly:

1.  **Open DevTools:** Press **F12** or right-click the page and select **Inspect / Inspect Element**.
2.  **Go to the Console:** Navigate to the **Console** tab within the DevTools window.
3.  **Copy the Output:** Copy the entire log output from the Console.
4.  **Submit the Issue:**
    * Go to our official repository: **[https://github.com/SlizR/DrawPix](https://github.com/SlizR/DrawPix)**
    * Navigate to the **Issues** tab and select the template for a **Bug Report**.
    * Describe what you were trying to do, what happened, and what you expected to happen.
    * Paste the copied console log at the bottom of your report.

Providing this information helps us determine if the problem is on the server side or a client-side issue, and we will guide you on the necessary steps to resolve it. Experienced developers are encouraged to provide additional details from the Network or Security tabs in DevTools for a deeper analysis of server or security-related problems.

And also if you get an error and it turns out that it is, for example, Error Connection to Server or something else on your client side, try going to [HELP.md](https://github.com/SlizR/DrawPix/blob/main/HELP.md) where it is described why this is and how to solve it

2.  Navigate to the **Issues** tab and select the template for a **Feature Request** or **Idea**.
